## Task 2: Create the Bootstrap Code  (CLOSED 2026-09-22)

This task was called Experiment 1 while it ran.  The text below, and
several issues, still use that name.

{The last sentence is a note from the future.  The name was settled
while Task 4 ran; when this task began no such package existed, which is
what the rest of the paragraph assumes.}

This experiment assumes that eventually there will be a pip installable
package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org) (i.e. the Python Package Index web site)
that contains a package that has an `AltVEnv` class.  The package is
named `alt-venv` on PyPI and imports as `alt_venv`.

The bootstrap code will live in every program that needs to bootstrap this
code into their program.  This bootstrap code will assume that the
Python3 distribution being used has a small number of packages like
`venv`, `pip`, and `importlib` preinstalled.

The code will create a `~/.alt_venv` directory and initialize it
using the `venv` package.  The bootstrap is to be a pure Python program
that does not cheat by directly executing `python3 -m pip install XXX`.
Only `venv` and other "standard" Python libraries are to be used.  Finally,
the `coverage` package will be imported using the `importlib` package.

In general, the bootstrap program should be optimized to be a relatively
small number of lines.  Do not do this optimization just yet.

The twelve mechanisms, measured by `bootstrap.py` itself.  What the
columns mean is in its module docstring.

{Step 6.1 of Task 6 wrapped the fetch in a three line `try` on
2026-09-26, so every `paste` figure above is now three higher: 27, 27,
52, 33, 27, 18, 18, 22, 18, 18, 33 and 58 for cases 1 to 12.  The
wrapper turns a failed fetch into one line of diagnosis instead of a
traceback, which is the `0whwnn` issue.}

### Findings

1. **`venv.EnvBuilder` does not default to symlinks; the command
   line does.**  `python3 -m venv` passes `symlinks=True` on POSIX,
   but `EnvBuilder()`'s own default is `symlinks=False`, which
   copies the 7.7 MB interpreter into `bin/python`, `bin/python3`
   and `bin/python3.12`.  That is 35.7 MB against 12.7 MB for an
   otherwise byte-identical tree of 1013 files; the 23 MB gap is
   exactly those three copies.  Creation takes ~3.1 s either way,
   so the cost is purely disk.  The earlier exploration never saw
   this, because it used the command line.

2. **`ensurepip` is essentially the entire cost of making a venv.**
   `EnvBuilder(with_pip=False)` builds one in 0.05 s and 28 KB,
   against 3.1 s and 12.7 MB with pip.  Nearly everything a venv
   costs is the pip it installs into itself.

3. **The venv is never load-bearing.**  `pip install --target`
   needs no virtual environment at all.  Case 6 skips the venv and
   costs 15 pasted lines and 1762 KB; case 1 builds one and costs
   24 lines and 16981 KB, for identical observable behaviour.
   The earlier exploration reached this conclusion by argument,
   from the venv side.  It is now measured from the bootstrap side
   and the numbers agree.

4. **Running pip in process is not free of the user's program.**
   After one in-process install, `sys.modules` grows from 99
   entries to 740, 451 of them pip's, and pip leaves three
   `RichPipStreamHandler` objects on the *root* logger.  The same
   `log.warning("hello")` prints bare before the bootstrap runs and
   `WARNING: hello` through pip's handler afterwards, on a
   different stream.  Six of the twelve cases do this.  The subprocess
   cases cannot: that state dies with the child.  This is the
   strongest argument against the in-process mechanism, and it was
   not visible until it was measured.

5. **pip can be imported straight out of its own wheel.**  A wheel
   is a zip and zips are importable, so
   `sys.path.insert(0, "<...>/pip-24.0-py3-none-any.whl")` makes
   pip importable without installing it anywhere -- no venv, no
   network, and nothing written to disk for pip itself.  Case 8
   does this in 15 lines.

6. **Debian de-vendors `ensurepip`, and misnames the package that
   carries it.**  There is no `ensurepip/_bundled` directory on
   this machine; `_WHEEL_PKG_DIR` points at
   `/usr/share/python-wheels/`, which holds
   `pip-24.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `setuptools-68.1.2-...whl`.
   That confirms the de-vendoring the Problem Statement describes.

   The package layout is the surprise.  `python3.12-venv` contains
   `ensurepip` and nothing else -- three files.  The `venv` module
   itself lives in `libpython3.12-stdlib`, the base package.  So
   `import venv` succeeds on a machine that does not have
   `python3-venv` installed, while `python3 -m venv` fails there,
   because venv calls `ensurepip` to put pip inside the
   environment it builds.

   Whoever designs Experiment 2 should know that `import venv` is
   therefore not a valid probe for whether a virtual environment
   can be built; it answers yes on a machine where the answer is
   no.  The probes that discriminate are `import ensurepip` and
   `python3 -m venv` itself.  Measured with `dpkg -L` and
   `dpkg -S` on one Ubuntu 24.04 box.  Debian is believed to be
   laid out the same way, which is not verified here.

7. **Reclaiming pip after the fact works.**  Deleting the venv's
   `pip`, its `pip-*.dist-info` and `bin/pip*` takes the tree from
   16981 KB to 1790 KB.  `coverage` still imports afterwards, a
   second package still installs by the pure-stdlib path, and
   `ensurepip` can put pip back if it is ever wanted again.  This
   is the right answer for a machine that has `venv` but no pip --
   and only for that machine, because `with_pip=False` reaches the
   same size for 6 fewer pasted lines wherever a system pip exists.
   Two cases do this reclaim and measure identically: case 4
   imports the manufactured pip, case 11 runs the venv's own
   interpreter as a child instead.  Case 11 is the one to ship,
   because it needs nothing from `pip._internal`.

8. **`--no-compile` is worth almost nothing.**  60 KB, and 40
   `.pyc` files against 44, because the bootstrap imports the
   package two lines later and Python compiles what it imports
   anyway.  Rounding sizes to `1.7 MB` had made this look like a
   100 KB saving; reporting kilobytes killed the idea.

9. **`.pth` files are inert under `sys.path.insert`.**  Every case
   installs coverage's `a1_coverage.pth`, its hook for measuring
   subprocesses, and no case executes it; only `site.addsitedir()`
   would.  Any package that relies on a `.pth` is quietly
   half-installed by every mechanism here.

10. **Independence from pip costs 49 pasted lines against 15.**
    That is the whole trade, stated in one line.  The hand-rolled
    wheel-tag matcher agreed with pip's choice for one package on
    one platform, including the compiled
    `tracer.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`, and it cannot tell
    musl from glibc.  Case 3 also produces the smallest tree,
    1682 KB, because it never generates the three `coverage`
    console scripts that `pip --target` writes into `bin/`.

**Where this departed from the instructions above.**  The
instructions asked for four things: build `~/.alt_venv` using
`venv`, do not cheat by executing `python3 -m pip install`, use
only `venv` and other standard libraries, and import through
`importlib`.  Every case does the last of those.  No case does the
other three at once.

Cases 1, 4 and 5 build the venv and spawn nothing, but reach into
`pip._internal`, which is not a standard library.  Case 3 uses
nothing but standard libraries and spawns nothing, at the cost of
building no venv at all.  Cases 2, 7, 10 and 11 spawn pip, which
the instructions call cheating, and case 11 is the one finding 7
recommends.

Case 12 was then written to close that gap, and it is the only
one of the twelve that does all four: a venv built with
`with_pip=False`, filled by case 3's wheel fetcher.  It costs 55
pasted lines against case 3's 49, and 1714 KB against 1682.  So
the instructions were satisfiable after all, and the price of
satisfying them is 6 lines and 32 KB spent on a virtual
environment that nothing subsequently reads.  That is finding 3
arriving from the other side: the venv the instructions mandate is
not load-bearing, and now that has been measured rather than
argued.

**What Experiment 1 did not settle.**  The baseline question that
Experiment 2 exists for is untouched.  Every row of that table was
measured on one Ubuntu 24.04 machine that has `venv`, `ensurepip`
and `pip` all present.

What the experiment did produce is a priced answer for each way
that question could come out.  With `pip` importable, 15 pasted
lines.  With `pip` gone but `ensurepip` present to manufacture
one, 30.  With neither, 49 -- or 55 if a virtual environment is
wanted for its own sake.  Finding 6 is why those are phrased
around `ensurepip` rather than `venv`: `venv` is in the base
standard library and is effectively always present, so it is not
the thing that varies.  Which of these the project actually needs
is still the thing to measure.

**A defect worth recording.**  Experiment 1 also turned up a bug
that all twelve cases share, written up as `2apiia`.  It affects
every case equally, so it does not disturb the comparison above.

### Task 2 Summary

Twelve mechanisms were written into one `bootstrap.py`, each a
self-contained case that a program could paste, and measured against
each other.  The table above is that measurement.

The central finding is that the virtual environment is never load
bearing.  `pip install --target` installs into any directory, so a case
that builds a venv and a case that skips it reach identical behaviour --
15 pasted lines against 24, and 1762 KB against 16981.  Nearly all of
what a venv costs is the `pip` that `ensurepip` puts inside it.

Two mechanisms turned out to be unsafe rather than merely expensive.
Driving `pip` in process leaves 451 of its modules in `sys.modules` and
three of its handlers on the caller's root logger.  Reaching into
`pip._internal` at all uses a private interface, recorded as `0pinpa`.

One packaging fact matters more than it looks.  Debian ships `venv` in
the base standard library package but splits `ensurepip` into
`python3.12-venv`, so `import venv` succeeds on a machine where
`python3 -m venv` fails.  The probes that discriminate are
`import ensurepip` and `python3 -m venv` itself.

What this task did not settle is which mechanism to ship, because that
depended on what a stock machine actually provides.  Task 3 settled it
by deciding rather than by measuring.
