# 3 Master `pip` and package servers: History

## Task 3: Master `pip` and Package Servers  (CLOSED 2026-09-24)

This task was called Experiment 2 while it ran.  The text below, several
issues, and `alt_venv_test.py` still use that name.

{`alt_venv` was developed during this task, so "to be developed"
describes only where it started.}

The ultimate goal is to build a testing framework that allows installing
the `alt_venv` (to be developed) package from a `pip` compatible
server (e.g. `pypiserver`) and load it into a program via the bootstrap
technology developed in the previous experiment.

Here is the task list, with what is done struck from it:

* DONE.  Build a wheel for `alt_venv.py`, and lay it out as a
  PEP 503 tree.  Both are in `alt_venv_test.py` and use
  nothing but the standard library.
* DONE.  Let the environment aim `bootstrap.py` at that tree,
  through `PIP_INDEX_URL` and `BOOTSTRAP_PACKAGE`.
* Fill in `AltVEnv` with something worth fetching.
* End-to-end: run a `bootstrap.py` case against the local tree and
  check that `alt_venv` lands in `~/.alt_venv` and
  imports.
* Failure testing: an index missing the package, a truncated wheel,
  a missing `index.html`.
* Eventually, a real package server, which is the only way to test
  cases 3 and 12.

Some initial conclusions after some research and discussion:
* Preinstalled Python environment.  What follows was measured on one
  Ubuntu 24.04 machine.  We will *eventually* survey Ubuntu, Redhat,
  Windows, and MacOS systems to turn these assumptions into facts.
  * Not every Python installation has the whole standard library, but
    the parts the bootstrap uses -- `importlib`, `pathlib`, `ssl`,
    `subprocess`, `sysconfig`, `urllib.request`, `venv`, `zipfile`
    and friends -- are all either compiled into `python3` or in a
    base package Debian marks `Priority: important`.  Assuming those
    is effectively assuming Python itself.
  * Exactly one thing must additionally be preinstalled: `pip`, from
    the `Priority: optional` package `python3-pip`.  `ensurepip`, in
    `python3.12-venv`, is the only other optional piece, and is
    needed only by the cases that manufacture a `pip`.
  * A working TLS trust store (`ca-certificates`) is also required,
    since every case fetches over HTTPS.  `python3-pip` depends on
    it, so requiring `pip` brings it along.
  * Once `pip` is present, any further Python package can be
    downloaded as needed.
* Package server for the test harness:
  A standard
  [PEP 503 directory tree](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) is to
  be used instead of a running full web server.  `pip --index-url`
  accepts a local directory laid out in that format, which removes
  any need to start and stop a server.  Later on, testing with an
  actual web server is necessary.
* `bootstrap.py` is not being merged into `alt_venv_test.py`.
  This allows `bootstrap.py` to perform end-to-end testing with
  a real Python package server, whereas `alt_venv_test.py` can
  use non server based testing.
* While there are tools that can generate a PEP 503 directory tree
  it easier to just manually generate the tree.

### Task 3 Summary

The pipeline works end to end.  A wheel is built from
`alt_venv.py`, published into a PEP 503 directory tree, fetched by
a `bootstrap.py` case pointed there by environment variables alone,
installed into `~/.alt_venv`, and imported.  Both builders live in
`alt_venv_test.py` and use nothing but the standard library, so no
packaging tool had to be installed to make a package.

`AltVEnv` stopped being empty.  Constructing one creates the cache
directory and writes a `README.md` into it from the constructor's own
docstring.  `install()` installs a package into the cache with
`pip install --target` and imports it, taking a separate distribution
name for the packages whose PyPI name and import name differ, and
raising `RuntimeError` carrying pip's standard error when the fetch
fails.

Four things were measured rather than assumed.  `pip install --target`
is not blocked by PEP 668, so it works on exactly the distributions
that refuse a plain `pip install`.  `pip` honours `PIP_INDEX_URL` from
the environment, so a case is steered without editing it and the
`paste` column stays honest.  A local directory index needs real
`index.html` pages; wheels alone are not enough.  And the whole of what
the bootstrap needs preinstalled is one package, `python3-pip`, plus a
TLS trust store that `python3-pip` already depends on.

Three items did not get done and carry over to Task 5: an automated end
to end test through `bootstrap.py`, the remaining failure cases, and
the real package server that cases 3 and 12 require.
